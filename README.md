# Translation Guidelines
This is a translation of [AMQ](https://animemusicquiz.com/) into Norwegian. 

Generally it has been attempted to use as many Norwegian word as possible, and only use English words when it relating to gaming terms (i.e., offline, ranked, skin),  things that can be seen as proper nouns (i.e. Nexus, in-game currencies), when there English terminology has been used in other circumstances (i.e. game and match in tennis) or when the Norwegian translation has little to no usage (i.e. FAQ).

**Currently guidelines are NOT final.** Due to the size of the current translation group there has been few lenghty discussions about translation guideline, and therefore they may change at a later date when more deiscussions are done.

## Deliberate Word choices
- Community - Felleskap
- Themed Quiz - Temaquiz
- Email - E-post / E-postadresse (Context depentent)

## Don't Translate
- **Nexus** - Nexus is seen as a proper noun
- **FAQ** - While some site (like [Wikipedia](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ofte_stilte_sp%C3%B8rsm%C3%A5l)) use the Norwegian version of OSS. FAQ seem to be more wildly understood, and fits better in the FAQ box, than something like "Vanlige Spørsmål"
- **Ticket**, **Rhythm**, **Avatar Token** - These are seen as in-game currency and decided therefore not to translate them into Norwegian similar to real life currencies
- **Match**, **Game** - Decided to translate this like if they where tennis terms
- **Skin** - While some games translate the "skin" into some Norwegian word, we have decided to stick with the original English word.
- **Ranked** - Decided to not to translate.

## Words Needing Deliberation

- **Novice** - Currently translated as "Novise".
