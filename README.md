# Translation Guidelines
This is a translation of [AMQ](https://animemusicquiz.com/) into Norwegian. 

Currently all the translation has been done by [NMapper](https://github.com/N-Mapper) so most decisions have been by them, with some community input. Generally it has been attempted to use as many Norwegian word as possible, unless there is a reasonable usage of an English word or phrase either in common Norwegian usage or is common Norwegian gamer vocabulary. 

**Currently none of Guidelines are final.** Due to the size of the current translation group pretty much exclusively consisting of NMapper, and may change at a later date.

## Deliberate Word choices
- Community - Felleskap
- Themed Quiz - Temaquiz
- Email - E-post / E-postadresse (Context depentent)

## Don't Translate
- **Nexus** - Nexus is seen as a proper noun
- **FAQ** - While some site (like [Wikipedia](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ofte_stilte_sp%C3%B8rsm%C3%A5l)) use the Norwegian version of OSS. FAQ seem to be more wildly understood, and fits better in the FAQ box, than something like "Vanlige Spørsmål"
- **Ticket**, **Rhythm**, **Avatar Token** - These are seen as in-game currency and decided therefore not to translate them into Norwegian similar to real life currencies
- **Match**, **Game** - Decided to translate this like if they where tennis terms
- **Skin** - While some games translate the "skin" into some Norwegian word, we have decided to stick with the original English word.

## Words Needing Deliberation
- **Ranked** - Currently not translated.
- **Novice** - Currently translated as "Novise".
